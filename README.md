# Overview
Roza is a biological researcher who is reponsible for studying and recording bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered up with Improbable Beef, a food startup, to research candidate species. She hypothesizes that the bacterial species to make synthetic beef, may be found in the belly button. To test her hypothesis, Roza has sampled the navels of people across the country to idneitify bacterial specieis that colonize our belly buttons. Each person has been anonymounized and given an ID number. Roza wants to build a dashboard that both her, her research participants, and fellow researchers can access; allowing them to see which bacterial species live in their navels. 

## Completed tasks

- initialize variables that hold arrays for the sample that is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.
- create a bubble chart that will display the following when an individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu
- create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart
- Use your knowledge of HTML and Bootstrap to customize the webpage for your dashboard
- Add an image to the jumbotron.
